## Data structures

### Linear data structures

#### Array

- **Definition**. Array is a fixed linear collection of elements of the same data type
  that are stored in consecutive memory locations and are referenced by an integer
  index. Array provides random access and constant time indexing
- **Time complexity**
    - Indexing: O(1)
    - Insertion: O(n)
    - Deletion: O(n)
    - Searching: O(n)
- **Characteristics**. Dynamic array automatically realocates memory when needed on
  insertions or deletions. Vector is a one-dimensional array. Matrix is a
  two-dimensional array

#### Linked list

- **Definition**. Linked list is a growing linear collection of elements (nodes) of the
  same data type that point to the next node in a list and are stored in random memory
  locations. Any number of elements can be added to a linked list. Linked list provides
  sequential access and constant time insertions and deletions at any point in the list
- **Time complexity**
- **Characteristics**. Singly linked list is a one-way traversal linked list in which
  every node points to the next node ina list
