## Data structures

### Linear data structures

#### Array

- **Definition**. Array is a collection of elements of the same data type that are
  stored in consecutive memory locations and are referenced by an integer index. Array
  provides random access with constant time indexing
- **Time complexity**
    - Indexing: O(1)
    - Insertion: O(n)
    - Deletion: O(n)
    - Searching: O(n)
- **Characteristics**. Dynamic array automatically realocates memory when needed on
  insertions or deletions. Vector is a one-dimensional array. Matrix is a
  two-dimensional array
